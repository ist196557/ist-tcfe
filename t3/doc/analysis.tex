\section{Comparing the theotherical analysis with the simulation.}\label{sec:Comparison}
In the first part of the circuit (transformer) we didn't notice any particular variation from the theoretical to the simulation
as we would expect since both ideal models were equal and the calculation were straightforward.

For the rest of the circuit it is normal that both can differ since the diode's model used in \emph{Ngspice}
is very complex whereas the model we decided to use in the theoretical analysis was
a simpler version.
Although the difference in both models used, we achieved very similar and satisfactory results.

The following graphs summarise the small differences:
