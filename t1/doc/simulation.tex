\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

We decided to, once again, put the circuit's scheme down below, so as to make the interpretation of the following results easier.

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. As can be seen, we obtianed similar results to the ones calculated in the theoretical analysis section. This is proof that our theoretical analysis is, indeed, correct.
We noticed, however, that \emph{Octave} rounded the values of the circuit's parameters ($R_{1}, ..., R_{7}, V_{a}, I_{d}, K_{b}, K_{c}$), whereas \emph{Ngspice} operated with the same precision as the one provided initially (no rounding).
As such, one could expect to find slightly different results. However, this did not prove to be the case.
